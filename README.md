# n-gram
A simple n-gram Language Model
n-gram is a stastical language model. It uses stastical information to help perdict.
This is an example of tri-gram which helps to understand.
I preprocessed the data in to a structure of ([wordA,wordB],wordC), and utilize a simple netword to train it.
The trained model can predict the next word given two words before it.
